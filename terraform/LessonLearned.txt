Challenge 1

 I have faced issue of access deneid  to the cdn url for a long time. SInce then
 tried multiple way to resolve it by checking the bucket policy and other areas.
 Through the analyis, i narrowed down the issue target endpoint of the cdn.
 The CDN was simply targeted on the bucket rather than bucket endpoint. so i changed to regional
 URL that directs to the website url. But still i had the issue. 
 Later, i recognized that cdn shoud point to root object that is index.html
 So i added the "default_root_object = "index.html""
 Then thigs have got smooth running.


Challenge 2
Default Certificate:

AWS CloudFront automatically provides a default SSL/TLS certificate for
the domain name of the distribution. This certificate is issued by Amazon and
is used to secure the connection between the client (browser) and CloudFront.
This default certificate covers the domain name in the format *.cloudfront.net, 
which is the default domain assigned to your CloudFront distribution (e.g., d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net).

Custom Domain Names:

If you use a custom domain name (e.g., www.example.com) for your CloudFront 
distribution, you typically need to associate an SSL/TLS certificate with it.
You can request a certificate through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and 
associate it with your CloudFront distribution.



Challenge 3

I was facing the issue with lambda function when i automate the lambda function with
GitHub action. The issue was that filename thrown error that it couldn't find the file.
I was not sure why this was throwing error. i tried to invoke the file from github repo
itself but yet it failed. After many attempts in many differnet ways. Finally found out the
way to upload dummy fuction code in the terraform itself. Later i would be able to update
the function usign CICD pipeline.

Challenge 4

The challenge was my user can't perform s3:PutBucketPolicy with because public policies
are blocked by the BlockPublicPolicy block public access setting yet provided with correct set
of permission and other stuff. After spending quit amount of time finally i was able to
find a silly mistake in the terraform excution flow.
There was a dependency on a resorce on other. Then i streamed line the process
Then got success.
